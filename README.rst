This goal of this homework assignment is to ensure that you are set up and prepared to use github to manage your code.

Do the following:

0. Set up ~/.gitconfig
1. Edit dictionary.csv, adding Centauri-Arcturan word-to-word translation pairs. Use git to add, commit, and push your changes back to your hw0 repository on github.
2. Create a program that uses the data in dictionary.csv to translate the Arcturan sentences from test.arcturan into Centauri. Use git to add, commit, and push your changes back to your hw0 repository on github.
3. Create an executable bash script called translate.sh that calls your program. Use git to add, commit, and push your changes back to your hw0 repository on github.
4. Run translate.sh
